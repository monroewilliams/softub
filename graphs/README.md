# Graphing scripts

These are the scripts I use to build graphs of the statistics reported by the hot tub controller over time.<br>

They're part of a larger set of scripts I use to graph various information about my local network on a server running [MRTG](https://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/)/[RRD](https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/index.en.html).<br>

They're set up for my specific configuration, so don't expect them to work out of the box, but they shouldn't be hard to adapt to any machine that has RRD installed.<br>

I'm providing them as-is for people to use as a starting point if they so choose.<br>

The scripts will generate graphs something like this:<br>
